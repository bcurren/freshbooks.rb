= Todo

Please send me a message if you are interested in contributing. Here is a quick overview of some things I'd like to add to the gem.

Merge in forked versions of this gem (any idea what forks are worth while?)
Provide a way to retrieve the error message with actions beside list are called.
Make ListProxy optional on list actions. Some people have valid reason to deal with pagination.
Add oAuth
Add webhooks
More tests including integration tests
Write some documentation and examples
Launch an official 3.0 (maybe call it 4.0) version of the gem
Post the official version to rubygems
Ensure rubygems aren't required for this gem. 

= About

FreshBooks.rb is a Ruby interface to the FreshBooks API. It exposes easy-to-use classes and methods for interacting with your FreshBooks account.

NOTE: These examples are out of date and need to be updated. I will be writing documentation for all the updates soon and will be pushing the changes to rubyforge in the near future.

= Examples

Initialization:

    FreshBooks::Base.establish_connection('sample.freshbooks.com', 'mytoken')

Updating a client name:

    clients = FreshBooks::Client.list
    client = clients[0]
    client.first_name = 'Suzy'
    client.update

Updating an invoice:

    invoice = FreshBooks::Invoice.get(4)
    invoice.lines[0].quantity += 1
    invoice.update

Creating a new item

    item = FreshBooks::Item.new
    item.name = 'A sample item'
    item.create
